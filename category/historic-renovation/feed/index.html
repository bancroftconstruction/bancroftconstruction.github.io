				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two-years and $90M, the Longwood Gardens Main Fountain Garden has returned to its glory!  Also referred to as the New Heights Fountain Revitalization Project, the Main Fountain Garden project involved the comprehensive restoration of Longwood Gardens’ most historical and featured attraction.  The Main Fountain Garden is one of the most expansive and magnificent groupings of fountains in a landscaped setting in the United States. Inspired by numerous fountain gardens in Europe, the Main Fountain Garden was designed and constructed under the direct supervision of Longwood founder, Pierre S. duPont, during a period extending from the early 1920s, when the first landscape features were planted, to the mid-1930s, when it acquired much of its present form. The Main Fountain Garden features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4,000</strong> pieces of carved Italian limestone, which were cleaned and repaired</li>
<li><strong>1/4 mile</strong> of underground tunnel</li>
<li><strong>1,340</strong> jets and streams added with restoration</li>
<li><strong>30</strong> flame features</li>
<li><strong>1,389</strong> LEDs added</li>
<li><strong>2,640</strong> Boxwoods planted</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the Summer of Spectacle on display now through September 30th!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monday evening marked the Donor Recognition and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for Uptown! Entertainment Alliance&#8217;s Knauer Performing Arts Center!  The repurposing of the former West Chester National Guard Armory converted the 10,900 square foot space into a 300-seat auditorium for live and screen performances.  The armory, which sat vacant since 2013, was built in 1916 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It formerly served as the home to the Pennsylvania National Guard unit which included 170 troops of Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 111th Infantry and 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team.</p>
