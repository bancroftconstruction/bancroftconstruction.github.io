				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Monday evening marked the Donor Recognition and Ribbon Cutting Ceremony for Uptown! Entertainment Alliance&#8217;s Knauer Performing Arts Center!  The repurposing of the former West Chester National Guard Armory converted the 10,900 square foot space into a 300-seat auditorium for live and screen performances.  The armory, which sat vacant since 2013, was built in 1916 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It formerly served as the home to the Pennsylvania National Guard unit which included 170 troops of Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 111th Infantry and 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On December 1st, Bancroft was on hand to help the Delaware Botanic Gardens celebrate the groundbreaking of their future botanic garden in Sussex County, DE!  Phase I of the planned garden has an anticipated opening of 2019 and will include a colorful natural meadow designed by world renowned Dutchman, Piet Oudolf.</p>
<p>With over 100 people in attendance Governor Markell said &#8220;I&#8217;m so impressed with what you&#8217;ve done here,&#8221; and called the garden&#8217;s initial development over the past four years &#8220;an awesome job.&#8221; As he told the garden leaders-including President Susan Ryan, Executive Director Sheryl Swed, and Vice President Ray Sander-&#8220;You had a very compelling vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bancroft will serve as Construction Manager for the project along with with award-winning architecture firm Lake/Flato, Pennoni, and Rodney Robinson of Robinson Anderson Summers.</p>
<p>The 37.5 acre site off of Piney Neck Road in Dagsboro, DE will eventually be developed to include a meadow garden, coastal living garden, special events space, grotto and a boardwalk leading to water access of Pepper Creek.</p>
