				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two-years and $90M, the Longwood Gardens Main Fountain Garden has returned to its glory!  Also referred to as the New Heights Fountain Revitalization Project, the Main Fountain Garden project involved the comprehensive restoration of Longwood Gardens’ most historical and featured attraction.  The Main Fountain Garden is one of the most expansive and magnificent groupings of fountains in a landscaped setting in the United States. Inspired by numerous fountain gardens in Europe, the Main Fountain Garden was designed and constructed under the direct supervision of Longwood founder, Pierre S. duPont, during a period extending from the early 1920s, when the first landscape features were planted, to the mid-1930s, when it acquired much of its present form. The Main Fountain Garden features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4,000</strong> pieces of carved Italian limestone, which were cleaned and repaired</li>
<li><strong>1/4 mile</strong> of underground tunnel</li>
<li><strong>1,340</strong> jets and streams added with restoration</li>
<li><strong>30</strong> flame features</li>
<li><strong>1,389</strong> LEDs added</li>
<li><strong>2,640</strong> Boxwoods planted</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the Summer of Spectacle on display now through September 30th!</p>
