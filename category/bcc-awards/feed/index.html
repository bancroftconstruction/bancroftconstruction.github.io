				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bancroft has again been named in the top 9% as a <a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/business/2018/08/26/delawares-2018-top-workplaces/1102865002/">Top Workplace</a> by the Delaware News Journal out of 653 invited companies. Bancroft was also invited to and honored as a Top Workplace in 2017. The title is confirmation of the many positive employee-focused initiatives and activities of which Bancroft dedicates its resources, such as an employee appreciation program, ongoing training and certifications, safety and wellness strategies, and company-wide events. <div class="su-spacer" style="height:-5px"></div>
<p>“To be named as a Top Workplace in the top 9% of invited companies is truly an honor. To be named as a Top Workplace for a second consecutive year is even more exciting for us at Bancroft,” said Greg Sawka, President and CEO of Bancroft Construction Company. “Our teammates work incredibly hard every day and hold themselves to a high standard to continually exceed our client and our project expectations. They are the embodiment of our Guiding Principles and make Bancroft what it is today.”</p>
<p>The Top Workplaces list is based solely on employee feedback gathered through a third-party survey administered by research partner Energage, LLC, a leading provider of technology-based employee engagement tools. The anonymous survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, and connection, just to name a few.</p>
<p>“Becoming a Top Workplace…is an achievement organizations have worked for and a distinction that gives them a competitive advantage,” said Doug Claffey, CEO of Energage. “Our research shows organizations that earn the award attract better talent, experience lower turnover, and are better equipped to deliver bottom-line results. Their leaders prioritize and carefully craft a healthy workplace culture that supports employee engagement.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bancroft is pleased to announce that we have been named to the News Journal&#8217;s 2017 Top Workplaces list! The Top Workplaces award evaluates companies on their organizational health and workplace improvement strategies.  It assessed our business culture in categories such as alignment, execution, and connection.  This is not an easy award to win – of the 12,000 companies who applied, only 8% were invited to participate in the survey.  The Top Workplaces awards are based <strong><em>solely</em></strong> on the results of an employee feedback survey. Without our team, this would not have been made possible!</p>
